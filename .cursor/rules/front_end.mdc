# Cursor Rules

This file outlines the project guidelines. Follow these rules to ensure a consistent and maintainable codebase.

---

## 1. Technologies

- **Vue:** 3.5  
- **Build Tool:** Vite 6  
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind 4 with DaisyUI 5  
- **Runtime:** Node 18  
- **Backend:** Supabase  

*Do not introduce any new frameworks without approval.*

---

## 2. Documentation

- Store all documentation in the `docs` folder.
- Keep the top-level README updated with every change.

---

## 3. CSS & Design

- Define all CSS in a main stylesheet (avoid inline styles).
- Organize CSS so the main color scheme can be easily redefined.
- Ensure the design is responsive for both desktop and mobile.

---

## 4. Routing & Layout

- Use a standard router.
- Implement an outer container that includes:
  - Branding (e.g., logo)
  - Navigation menu
  - Footer (on desktop)
- Inside the outer container, place the main content pane(s).

---

## 5. Project Structure

- Follow a consistent project structure with predictable file and folder locations.
- Before creating new folders, files, types, or functions, check if they already exist.
- Modify existing items when possible rather than duplicating code.

---

## 6. Modification Guidelines

- **Targeted Changes:** Limit edits strictly to what you're intentionally modifying.
- **Avoid Unintended Edits:** Do not alter unrelated parts of any file (e.g., configuration or environment values).
