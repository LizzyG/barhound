### Core Features

#### 1. Location Services
- Request user location permission

- Store user's preferred location for future visits (in local storage)

#### 2. Interactive Map
- Leaflet-based map centered on user's location or default location (Portland, OR)
- Pins representing bars that match current filters
- Interactive pins that highlight corresponding bar card when clicked
- Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile

#### 3. Filter System
- Core filter attributes (6 total):
  - Live music
  - Dog-friendly
  - Pool tables
  - Happy hour specials
  - Outdoor seating
  - Good for watching sports
- Additional filter options:
  - Opening hours
  - Price range
  - Rating
  - Distance from current location
- Filter UI at the top of the page
- Clear all filters button

#### 4. Bar Listings
- Card-based display of bars matching current filters
- Each card includes:
  - Bar name and logo/image
  - Address and distance from current location
  - Rating
  - Attribute chips (visual indicators of matching filters)
  - Brief description
  - Operating hours
- Cards should visually connect to map pins
- Clicking a card should highlight the corresponding pin on the map

### Database Schema

#### Bars Table
```
id: UUID (primary key)
name: String
address: String
latitude: Float
longitude: Float
phone_number: String
website: String
google_place_id: String
rating: Float
price_level: Integer
photo_references: Array<String>
created_at: Timestamp

```

#### Bar Attributes Table
```
id: UUID (primary key)
bar_id: UUID (foreign key to bars.id)
attribute_id: UUID (foreign key to attributes.id)
value: Boolean/String/Integer (depending on attribute type)

source: String (e.g., "google_places", "ai_analysis")
created_at: Timestamp
updated_at: Timestamp
```

#### Attributes Table (Core Attributes)
```
id: UUID (primary key)
name: String (e.g., "has_live_music", "is_dog_friendly", "has_pool_tables", "has_happy_hour", "has_outdoor_seating", "good_for_sports")
display_name: String (e.g., "Live Music", "Dog Friendly", "Pool Tables", "Happy Hour", "Outdoor Seating", "Sports Viewing")

- Desktop: Sidebar with filters, main content area with map and bar listings
- Mobile: Filters accessible via expandable panel, toggleable views between map and listings

#### Color Scheme
- Primary color scheme defined in a main CSS file for easy theming
- Dark mode support (future enhancement)

#### Components
1. **Header**
   - Logo and branding
   - Navigation menu
   - Location selector

### Data Collection Process

1. **Google Places API Integration**
   - Weekly scheduled cronjob to fetch bar data for Portland, Oregon area
   - Implement cost-limiting logic to avoid excessive API usage:
     - Prioritize updating bars with older data first
     - Limit number of API calls per run
     - Focus on bars with high user engagement (future enhancement)
   - Store basic information (name, address, hours, etc.)
   - Download and store references to photos

2. **AI Analysis Pipeline**
   - Fetch reviews for each bar
   - Use AI to analyze reviews and extract mentions of the 6 core attributes
   - Assign confidence scores to AI-derived attributes
   - Store results in the database

### Future Enhancements

1. **User Accounts**
   - Favorites and saved filters
   - Review submission
   - Social features (sharing, recommendations)

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Time-based filtering (e.g., "Open now" or "Open on Sundays after 8 PM")
   - Compound filters (e.g., "Has pool tables AND allows dogs")

3. **Crowdsourced Data**
   - Allow users to submit corrections or additional information
   - Verification system for user-submitted data

4. **Mobile App**
   - Native mobile applications using capacitor or similar technology

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP
- Basic map and filter functionality for the 6 core attributes
- Anonymous read-only access to Supabase
- Default location set to Portland, Oregon
- Simple UI with basic responsiveness
- Weekly data refresh via cronjob with cost-limiting logic

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Improved UI/UX with animations and transitions
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced filtering options
- Expanded geographic coverage

### Phase 3: User Accounts and Social Features
- User registration and authentication
- Personalization features
- Social sharing capabilities
- User-submitted corrections and additions

## Data Refresh Strategy

To manage API costs while keeping data fresh, we'll implement the following strategy:

1. **Tiered Refresh Schedule**:
   - Basic data (name, location, hours): Refresh every 4 weeks
   - Photos and attributes: Refresh every 8 weeks
   - Reviews (for AI analysis): Refresh every 2 weeks for popular bars, 4 weeks for others

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process a maximum of 100 bars per weekly run
   - Prioritize bars with oldest refresh dates

3. **Change Detection**:
   - Track significant changes between refreshes
   - Flag bars with major changes for manual review

4. **API Usage Monitoring**:
   - Implement logging of all API calls
   - Set up alerts for approaching API limits
   - Automatically pause refreshes if approaching cost thresholds
