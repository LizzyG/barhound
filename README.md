# BarHound

BarHound is a web application that helps users find nearby bars that match specific criteria such as opening hours, amenities (pool tables, dart boards), policies (dog-friendly), and more.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the design and planning phase. See the documentation in the [docs](docs/) folder:
